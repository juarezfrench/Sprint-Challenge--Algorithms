#### Please add your answers to the ***Analysis of  Algorithms*** exercises here.

## Exercise I

a) I'd call this O(n), as each item added to the array adds another step in the while loop.

b) For loop will run n times making O(n) while loop runs through half (n/2) becasue j*=2 so O(n log(n))

c) I'd say this is an O(c), only one argument can be passed in and regardless of the size of the arguent, the number of operations performed does not change. 

## Exercise II
